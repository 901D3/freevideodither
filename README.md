## **A tool for dither video instead of image**

This is a website for dithering videos, you can change dithering methods and some more settings(greyed dithering methods means it isnt avalable)\
For your privacy, this site will automatically delete the uploaded file after you reload or exit the page as it just a temporary file\
some question you may ask:\
Why did you make this site?\
Well its bc i want to dither video in Davinci Resolve so i go online and find some fuse plugins but the plugin by Akascape is the only dither plugin that is available for dr and it cost money so i make this\
Why this is called freevideodithering instead of video dithering? is there a paid one?\
I call it freevideodithering bc it was free, there is no paid as i want this to be free and everyone can use it\
### ***Note:***
This tool does not dither based on the color palletes, instead it get the\
pixel infomation in the frame of video so you dont have to make you own color palletes

## ***Features***
