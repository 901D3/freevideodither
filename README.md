## **A tool for video dithering**
...that is fast, tons of features, _**hard to use**_ but it's all free!\
I was fascinated by dithering effect and i wanted to apply that dithering effect to a video...\
well someone did make a Resolve pluggin for video dithering but it was paid\
and the demo video shows that it's nothing compared to error diffusion or bayer.

Video dithering tools was rare as hell and most of them was paid,\
some tutorials is done in AE but i don't even have money to buy AE so i made this from those frustration yeah\
A middle finger to paid video dithering tools

It's kinda hard to use but i did make some tooltips so you over on some settings it will show the tooltip.\
Once you know how to use it, it becomes powerful as hell im not kidding

For anyone using phones, it is recommended to go landscape mode for best UI viewing

Error diffusion
Variable error diffusion

Blue noise(in matrix threshold)

Linear color space
